Understanding the task

'Does the task suggest a supervised or an unsupervised approach?'
Since the data set is labeled, a supervised approach would be appropriate.

'Are you trying to predict a discrete or a continuous value?'
We're predicting median house price of some block group, a continuous variable.

'Which ML algorithm is most suitable?'
As we are predicting a continuous variable, so we should use regression.
Whether we should be using a linear or non-linear model is yet to be determined. Before we make the decision we need to experiment with the data.
